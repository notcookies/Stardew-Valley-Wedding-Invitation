# Phase 1 Final Project

If you've ever been playing Stardew Valley and have been overwhelemed by the fishing, you're
not the only one. This app will allow you to search for what fish you'll need to complete the game at 100%, it'll give the full description of the seasons, weather conditions, time of day the fish appear and location that are associated with. With the search bar you can specifically look up which fish you'll need and it will appear with the photo, hit the 'See More' button and the description will appear below. If you would like to see a full list of the fish that the game has all you have to do is press on the 'See All' button and the entire list will appear on the page, once again hitting the 'See More' button to view the description.
